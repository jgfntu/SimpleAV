SimpleAV is (somewhat) usable now. Your comments are always welcome.
It is released under LGPL v3.

Current version is 0.0.5b2, based on libav v0.6.2.
Syncing is almost perfectly supported -- no need to do that yourself anymore!

The next version will be 0.0.5 or 0.1.0, featuring:
 * better Audio-Video syncing;
 * a more complete API;

With SimpleAV, you could write a multimedia player that supports seeking and pausing in 99 lines.
Read "player2.c" if you are interested. :-P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION:

Currently, SimpleAV uses cmake to compile the sample code, "player2.c".
You could compile it with the following steps:

    1. cd build/
    2. cmake ..
    3. make

"saplayer.c" is the old sample code: as you see, the newer one is much shorter!

And, please pay attention that SimpleAV itself doesn't include libav/ffmpeg. You need to download and install it yourself.
SimpleAV works well under libav v0.6.2. If you want to try other versions of libav, take your own risk; and your feedback is always welcome(thanks!).

SimpleAV will not generate libs like libSimpleAV.a and install them for you until it is enough mature and stable. So, be patient, and stay tuned!

SimpleAV makes you able to write a nice video player in less than 100 lines.
It is released under LGPL v3.

Current version is 0.0.5, based on libav v0.7.
Syncing is almost perfectly supported -- no need to do that yourself anymore!

The next version will features:
 * an improved API logic;
 * a more complete API;
 * (maybe) SFML support.

Start with "saplayer.c" if you are interested. :-P
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"saplayer-old.c" is the old (longer) sample code.
To compile it, you may need to do some hack.

And, please pay attention that SimpleAV itself doesn't include libav.
You need to download and install it yourself.

SimpleAV works well under libav v0.7.
BTW, I have never tested it under M$ Windows... Any volunteers?

SimpleAV will not generate compiled libs like libSimpleAV.a, until it is enouth
mature and stable. So, be patient, and stay tuned!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPILATION:

Currently, SimpleAV uses cmake to compile the sample code, "saplayer.c".
You could compile (and install, if you like) it with the following steps:

    1. cd build/
    2. cmake ..
    3. make
   (4. cd .. ; sudo cp saplayer /usr/local/bin)

Then have fun!

SimpleAV is still under heavy development. Thank you for your interest.

Current version is 0.0.3, based on libav v0.6.2.
Still does not support seeking yet; and you need to do the syncing job yourself.

Sample code is written in "test.c". You could compile it with "make".
Don't forget to install libav v0.6.9 first.

#+STARTUP: showall

* on going
** TODO redesign SimpleAV to make it easier to use.
   as simple as sf::sfeMovie.
   let SimpleAV do the dirty syncing job.
** TODO sync video to audio, or sync both of them to external clock.
   need to maintain video/audio clock.

* future
** TODO replace SDL/mutex with other implementations.
   so, write a 'configure', then rewrite 'Makefile'.
   it seems that pthread_mutex_* would work well under linux/BSD.
** TODO add support for manually downmixing.
   add a parameter to SA_open()?
** TODO subtitle support
   is that necessary?

* to make it perfect
** TODO reset img_convert_ctx when 'video size' changes.             :test.c:
** TODO improve SA_init, make its return value meaningful.           :SA_api:
   or change it into 'void SA_init(void)'.

* not clear yet
** TODO get clear what AUDIO_S16SYS is.                              :test.c:
** TODO figure out what caused the high CPU occupation.

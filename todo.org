#+STARTUP: showall

* on going
** TODO add seeking support.
*** TODO handle with static variables in audio_callback while seeking.
    modify test.c only. user's behavior.
    'sa_ap' needs to be freed.
** TODO sync video to audio, or sync both of them to external clock.
   need to maintain video/audio clock.


* future
** TODO replace SDL/mutex with other implementations.
   so, write a 'configure', then rewrite 'Makefile'.
   it seems that pthread_mutex_* would work well under linux/BSD.
** TODO add support for manually downmixing.
   add a parameter to SA_open().
** TODO subtitle support


* to make it perfect
** TODO add precise EOF detect/decodeing error report                :test.c:SA_api:
** TODO make SDL_PollEvent block? No 'SDL_Delay(10)' any more!       :test.c:
** TODO improve SA_init, make its return value meaningful.           :SA_api:
   or change it into 'void SA_init(void)'.

* not clear yet
** TODO get clear what AUDIO_S16SYS is                               :test.c:
